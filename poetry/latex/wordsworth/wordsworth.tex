\begin{verse}
	\begin{altverse} 
		
		I wandered lonely as a cloud\\
		That floats on high o'er vales and hills,\\
		When all at once I saw a crowd,\\
		A host, of golden daffodils;\\
		Beside the lake, beneath the trees,\\
		Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.\\!
		
		Continuous as the stars that shine\\
		And twinkle on the milky way,\\
		They stretched in never-ending line\\
		Along the margin of a bay:\\
		Ten thousand saw I at a glance,\\
		Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.\\!
		
		The waves beside them danced; but they\\
		Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:\\
		A poet could not but be gay,\\
		In such a jocund company:\\
		I gazed—and gazed—but little thought\\
		What wealth the show to me had brought:\\!
		
		For oft, when on my couch I lie\\
		In vacant or in pensive mood,\\
		They flash upon that inward eye\\
		Which is the bliss of solitude;\\
		And then my heart with pleasure fills,\\
		And dances with the daffodils.\\!
