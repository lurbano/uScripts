		Tyger Tyger, burning bright,\\
		In the forests of the night;\\
		What immortal hand or eye,\\
		Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\\!
		
		In what distant deeps or skies.\\
		Burnt the fire of thine eyes?\\
		On what wings dare he aspire?\\
		What the hand, dare seize the fire?\\!
		
		And what shoulder, \& what art,\\
		Could twist the sinews of thy heart?\\
		And when thy heart began to beat.\\
		What dread hand? \& what dread feet?\\!
		
		What the hammer? what the chain,\\
		In what furnace was thy brain?\\
		What the anvil? what dread grasp.\\
		Dare its deadly terrors clasp?\\!
		
		When the stars threw down their spears\\
		And water'd heaven with their tears:\\
		Did he smile his work to see?\\
		Did he who made the Lamb make thee?\\!
		
		Tyger Tyger burning bright,\\
		In the forests of the night:\\
		What immortal hand or eye,\\
		Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?\\!

\poemtitle{ A Poison Tree }
\begin{verse}
	\begin{altverse} 
		
		I was angry with my friend;\\
		I told my wrath, my wrath did end.\\
		I was angry with my foe:\\
		I told it not, my wrath did grow.\\!
		
		And I waterd it in fears,\\
		Night \& morning with my tears:\\
		And I sunned it with smiles,\\
		And with soft deceitful wiles.\\!
		
		And it grew both day and night.\\
		Till it bore an apple bright.\\
		And my foe beheld it shine,\\
		And he knew that it was mine.\\!
		
		And into my garden stole,\\
		When the night had veild the pole;\\
		In the morning glad I see;\\
		My foe outstretched beneath the tree.\\!

\poemtitle{ The Human Abstract }
\begin{verse}
	\begin{altverse} 
		
		Pity would be no more\\
		If we did not make somebody poor;\\
		And Mercy no more could be\\
		If all were as happy as we.\\!
		
		And mutual fear brings peace,\\
		Till the selfish loves increase;\\
		Then Cruelty knits a snare,\\
		And spreads his baits with care.\\!
		
		He sits down with holy fears,\\
		And waters the ground with tears;\\
		Then Humility takes its root\\
		Underneath his foot.\\!
		
		Soon spreads the dismal shade\\
		Of Mystery over his head;\\
		And the caterpillar and fly\\
		Feed on the Mystery.\\!
		
		And it bears the fruit of Deceit,\\
		Ruddy and sweet to eat;\\
		And the raven his nest has made\\
		In its thickest shade.\\!
		
		The Gods of the earth and sea\\
		Sought throâ€™ Nature to find this tree;\\
		But their search was all in vain:\\
		There grows one in the Human brain.\\!

\poemtitle{ Mock On, Mock On, Voltaire, Rousseau }
\begin{verse}
	\begin{altverse} 
		
		Mock on, mock on, Voltaire, Rousseau;\\
		Mock on, mock on; 'tis all in vain!\\
		You throw the sand against the wind,\\
		And the wind blows it back again.\\
		And every sand becomes a gem\\
		Reflected in the beams divine;\\
		Blown back they blind the mocking eye,\\
		But still in Israel's paths they shine.\\!
		
		The Atoms of Democritus\\
		And Newton's Particles of Light\\
		Are sands upon the Red Sea shore,\\
		Where Israel's tents do shine so bright.\\!

\poemtitle{ Auguries of Innocence }
\begin{verse}
	\begin{altverse} 
		
		To see a World in a Grain of Sand\\
		And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,\\
		Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand\\
		And Eternity in an hour.\\
		!
		A Robin Red breast in a Cage\\
		Puts all Heaven in a Rage.\\
		A dove house fill'd with doves \& Pigeons\\
		Shudders Hell thro' all its regions.\\
		!
		A dog starv'd at his Master's Gate\\
		Predicts the ruin of the State.\\
		A Horse misus'd upon the Road\\
		Calls to Heaven for Human blood.\\
		!
		Each outcry of the hunted Hare\\
		A fibre from the Brain does tear.\\
		A Skylark wounded in the wing,\\
		A Cherubim does cease to sing.\\
		!
		The Game Cock clipp'd and arm'd for fight\\
		Does the Rising Sun affright.\\
		Every Wolf's \& Lion's howl\\
		Raises from Hell a Human Soul.\\
		!
		The wild deer, wand'ring here \& there,\\
		Keeps the Human Soul from Care.\\
		The Lamb misus'd breeds public strife\\
		And yet forgives the Butcher's Knife.\\
		!
		The Bat that flits at close of Eve\\
		Has left the Brain that won't believe.\\
		The Owl that calls upon the Night\\
		Speaks the Unbeliever's fright.\\
		!
		He who shall hurt the little Wren\\
		Shall never be belov'd by Men.\\
		He who the Ox to wrath has mov'd\\
		Shall never be by Woman lov'd.\\
		!
		The wanton Boy that kills the Fly\\
		Shall feel the Spider's enmity.\\
		He who torments the Chafer's sprite\\
		Weaves a Bower in endless Night.\\
		!
		The Catterpillar on the Leaf\\
		Repeats to thee thy Mother's grief.\\
		Kill not the Moth nor Butterfly,\\
		For the Last Judgement draweth nigh.\\
		!
		He who shall train the Horse to War\\
		Shall never pass the Polar Bar.\\
		The Beggar's Dog \& Widow's Cat,\\
		Feed them \& thou wilt grow fat.\\
		!
		The Gnat that sings his Summer's song\\
		Poison gets from Slander's tongue.\\
		The poison of the Snake \& Newt\\
		Is the sweat of Envy's Foot.\\
		!
		The poison of the Honey Bee\\
		Is the Artist's Jealousy.\\
		The Prince's Robes \& Beggars' Rags\\
		Are Toadstools on the Miser's Bags.\\
		!
		A truth that's told with bad intent\\
		Beats all the Lies you can invent.\\
		It is right it should be so;\\
		Man was made for Joy \& Woe;\\
		!
		And when this we rightly know\\
		Thro' the World we safely go.\\
		Joy \& Woe are woven fine,\\
		A Clothing for the Soul divine;\\
		!
		Under every grief \& pine\\
		Runs a joy with silken twine.\\
		The Babe is more than swadling Bands;\\
		Throughout all these Human Lands\\
		!
		Tools were made, \& born were hands,\\
		Every Farmer Understands.\\
		Every Tear from Every Eye\\
		Becomes a Babe in Eternity.\\
		!
		This is caught by Females bright\\
		And return'd to its own delight.\\
		The Bleat, the Bark, Bellow \& Roar\\
		Are Waves that Beat on Heaven's Shore.\\
		!
		The Babe that weeps the Rod beneath\\
		Writes Revenge in realms of death.\\
		The Beggar's Rags, fluttering in Air,\\
		Does to Rags the Heavens tear.\\
		!
		The Soldier arm'd with Sword \& Gun,\\
		Palsied strikes the Summer's Sun.\\
		The poor Man's Farthing is worth more\\
		Than all the Gold on Afric's Shore.\\
		!
		One Mite wrung from the Labrer's hands\\
		Shall buy \& sell the Miser's lands:\\
		Or, if protected from on high,\\
		Does that whole Nation sell \& buy.\\
		!
		He who mocks the Infant's Faith\\
		Shall be mock'd in Age \& Death.\\
		He who shall teach the Child to Doubt\\
		The rotting Grave shall ne'er get out.\\
		!
		He who respects the Infant's faith\\
		Triumph's over Hell \& Death.\\
		The Child's Toys \& the Old Man's Reasons\\
		Are the Fruits of the Two seasons.\\
		!
		The Questioner, who sits so sly,\\
		Shall never know how to Reply.\\
		He who replies to words of Doubt\\
		Doth put the Light of Knowledge out.\\
		!
		The Strongest Poison ever known\\
		Came from Caesar's Laurel Crown.\\
		Nought can deform the Human Race\\
		Like the Armour's iron brace.\\
		!
		When Gold \& Gems adorn the Plow\\
		To peaceful Arts shall Envy Bow.\\
		A Riddle or the Cricket's Cry\\
		Is to Doubt a fit Reply.\\
		!
		The Emmet's Inch \& Eagle's Mile\\
		Make Lame Philosophy to smile.\\
		He who Doubts from what he sees\\
		Will ne'er believe, do what you Please.\\
		!
		If the Sun \& Moon should doubt\\
		They'd immediately Go out.\\
		To be in a Passion you Good may do,\\
		But no Good if a Passion is in you.\\
		!
		The Whore \& Gambler, by the State\\
		Licenc'd, build that Nation's Fate.\\
		The Harlot's cry from Street to Street\\
		Shall weave Old England's winding Sheet.\\
		!
		The Winner's Shout, the Loser's Curse,\\
		Dance before dead England's Hearse.\\
		Every Night \& every Morn\\
		Some to Misery are Born.\\
		!
		Every Morn \& every Night\\
		Some are Born to sweet Delight.\\
		Some ar Born to sweet Delight,\\
		Some are born to Endless Night.\\
		!
		We are led to Believe a Lie\\
		When we see not Thro' the Eye\\
		Which was Born in a Night to Perish in a Night\\
		When the Soul Slept in Beams of Light.\\
		!
		God Appears \& God is Light\\
		To those poor Souls who dwell in the Night,\\
		But does a Human Form Display\\
		To those who Dwell in Realms of day.\\!
